## What is a Subdomain?
A subdomain is a customizable extension of a main domain that functions as its own distinct web address. 
It appears before the primary domain name in the URL, separated by a dot. 
For example, if the main domain is **Amenazon.com**, a subdomain could be **yourbrand.amenazon.com**.

Subdomains allow you to create unique and memorable web addresses without needing to purchase an 
entirely new domain. They are often used for:

- **Personalized web pages** – Create a dedicated space that reflects your brand, business, or project.
- **Marketing and promotions** – Drive traffic to specific campaigns or offers.
- **Portfolio sites** – Showcase your work with a custom subdomain.
- **Redirects and shortcuts** – Use a subdomain to simplify long, complex URLs.

## Why Are Subdomains Valuable?
Subdomains provide a cost-effective and flexible way to establish an online presence. Instead of competing for expensive 
and hard-to-find domain names, you can leverage an existing domain with a strong identity. 
Here’s why subdomains are worth considering:

✅ **Memorable & Branded** – A subdomain keeps your branding strong while allowing for individuality.  
✅ **SEO Benefits** – Search engines recognize subdomains as separate entities, potentially boosting rankings for niche topics.  
✅ **No Need to Buy a New Domain** – Save money while still getting a unique web address.  
✅ **Custom Shortcuts** – Create a quick, easy-to-share URL that links to any website or online service.  
✅ **Flexibility** – Subdomains can host blogs, landing pages, storefronts, and more—all while connected to the main domain.
